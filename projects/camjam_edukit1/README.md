This repository contains the code and resources based on the [CamJam EduKit 1](https://camjam.me/?page_id=236). The original projects have been adapted to run on the [Raspberry Pi 4 QNX 8.0 Quick Start Target Image](https://gitlab.com/qnx/quick-start-images/raspberry-pi-qnx-8.0-quick-start-image).

Each project has been realized in Python and C.

* Worksheet 3 - Blinking LEDs ([Python](./worksheet3/python/), [C](./worksheet3/C/)
* Worksheet 4 - User Input ([Python](./worksheet4/python/), [C](./worksheet4/C/)
